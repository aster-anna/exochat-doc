# Follow up

## 0) Golden rules

1. Reply fast. First answer within 1–3 hours.
2. Always propose a next step. Date, time window, and agenda.
3. Keep one owner. One person communicates with a lead till closure.
4. Log every touch. Next step and data CRM/Notion.

## 1) When interest appears (can be adjusted)

Signals: asked for demo or docs, invited teammates, asked product or business questions.

### Timeline

- Day 0: reply and propose a call

• Within 24 hours: send invite and placeholder times

• 1–2 days after demo: recap with next steps

### Message 1: instant reply (LinkedIn or email)

Subject: ExoChat quick intro and next step

Hi, thank you for the interest. ExoChat helps companies design predictable, auditable AI conversations on top of any LLM. Teams use it to cut resolution time and reduce failure rates.

Would a short call this week work to see if a 10-day pilot makes sense? I can do Tue or Wed, 10:00–14:00 your time. Happy to adjust.

If easier, I can also send a one-pager and a 3-minute product overview.

### Calendar confirmation

Subject: Holding time for ExoChat intro

Great. I penciled in [Day, Time, Timezone]. Agenda: 5 min context, 10 min live demo, 5 min fit and next step. Please share teammates who should join.

### Pre-demo nudge (morning of the call)

Quick reminder for today’s ExoChat session at [time]. No prep needed. If you want specific use cases covered, send one line of context.

## 3) If they asked for “send materials” and went quiet

### Follow-up 1 (Day 4–5)

Subject: Quick check on ExoChat overview

Sharing in case useful. We can walk through a short demo or show how teams in [their function or industry] use ExoChat in production. Would next Tue or Wed work?

### Follow-up 2 (Day 10–12)

Subject: Should I keep this on hold?

Happy to pause if timing is not right. If any LLM-heavy teams around you are stuck with prompt chains and inconsistent outputs, we can help. If relevant, I can set a 15-minute walkthrough.

### Nurture update (about 1 month later)

Subject: Small update from ExoChat

We launched [feature] and started a pilot with a team in [industry]. If this aligns with current priorities, I can send a short summary.

---

## 4) If they redirect you inside the company

### New contact intro

Subject: Suggested to reach out regarding ExoChat

[Colleague/Investor] suggested you might be the right person. ExoChat lets teams design and control AI conversations with full audit trail. Happy to share a 3-minute overview or jump to a 10-day pilot on your data. Would [two time windows] work?

---

## 5) “Not now”

### Snooze and re-engage

Subject: Re-connecting as discussed

As planned, circling back. We have a few new teams launching pilots in [industry/use case]. If timing is better now, I can send a short plan or set a quick call.

---

## 6) Office clerks and assistants (gatekeepers)

Goal: politely reach the decision maker or get a warm internal intro.

### First message to an assistant

Subject: Brief coordination request for [Exec Name]

Hi, I am coordinating a short intro between our founder and [Exec Name] about ExoChat. It helps teams make AI conversations predictable and auditable, usually proven with a 10-day pilot.

Could you advise on the best way to schedule 15 minutes with [Exec Name] or the right person on their team? I will follow your process and share a one-page summary if helpful.

### If the assistant asks for info only

Subject: One-pager for [Exec Name]

Thank you. Attaching a one-pager and 3-minute overview. If relevant, we can prepare a pilot plan on two of their priority flows. Please let me know who should review it first and I will send it directly.

### If no reply in 5 business days

Subject: Gentle follow-up on scheduling

Kind reminder to check if we should route this to [Support/CX lead or RevOps lead] or keep it with [Exec Name]. Happy to send a draft pilot plan for faster review.

## 7) Owner workflow (who does what)

1. CEO or BizDev replies within 1–3 hours, proposes times.
2. CEO creates the shared chat and invites CTO for demo if needed.
3. After demo the owner sends recap, pilot plan, and locks the start date.
4. During pilot the owner sends Day-5 check-in and Day-10 results.
5. Owner moves to contract, shares order form and coordinates legal.
