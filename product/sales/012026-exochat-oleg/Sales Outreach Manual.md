# Sales Outreach Manual

**Goal:** A simple, repeatable process so reps can start outreach **today** using **Apollo (email)** + **LinkedIn (manual connects)** with **Notion** as the CRM of record.

---

## 0) Daily

- Send **email-first** sequences from Apollo.
- Do **manual** LinkedIn connects + short messages to matched prospects.
- Log everything in **Notion CRM** (stages + next step).
- Book **discovery → demo → 10-day pilot**.

---

## 1) Stack (what we use)

- **Apollo** — lead data, email verification, sequences, replies.
- **LinkedIn (personal)** — manual connects & short follow-ups (no automation).
- **Notion CRM** — pipeline stages, notes, KPIs (schema below).
- **Email** — dedicated outreach mailboxes: `name@exo-chat.com` (subdomain).

---

## 2) Setup (one-time)

### 2.1 Email & deliverability

- Create mailbox(es): `name@exo-chat.com` (by @Oleg Karakash  ).
- Configure **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** + tracking domain.
- **Ramp** per mailbox: Day 1: 20/day → add +10/day → cap at **100–150/day**.
- Keep emails **plain-text**, no images/attachments in first touch.

### 2.2 Apollo

- Connect mailboxes; set timezone & working hours.
- Build ICP filters **(middle+ & Enterprises)**: industry (SaaS/Fintech/E-com), size 500+, roles (Head of Support/CX, Head of Sales/RevOps, CPO/CTO).
- Create two sequences (below) and add **manual LI tasks** after Email 1/2.

### 2.3 Notion CRM (properties)

- **Stage** (select): New / Engaged / Discovery Scheduled / Demo Done / Pilot Proposed / Pilot Live / Decision / Won / Lost
- **Use case** (select): Lead-Qual / Support Triage / Onboarding
- **Primary KPI** (text): “+30% demo bookings” / “−20% AHT”, etc.

---

## 3) Daily routine (per rep)

**Morning (60–90 min)**

1. Refresh Apollo lists → add 40–80 new contacts (respect ramp).
2. Send sequence steps due today.
3. Personalize top 10 emails with 1–2 custom lines.

**Midday (30–45 min)**

4) **LinkedIn:** send **10–15 manual connects** to people you emailed.

5) Message new accepts (short, no links).

**Afternoon (60 min)**

6) Handle Apollo replies, book **Discovery 15 min**.

7) Update **Notion** (stage + next step).

**Evening (20 min)**

8) Prep tomorrow’s top 10 (accounts + lines).

**Weekly KPIs (target)**

- 300–400 emails sent, 50–70 LI touches, 8–12 discoveries, 2–3 demos, 1 pilot proposed.

---

## 4) Sequences (Apollo)

### 4.1 Seq A — Lead-Qualification (Sales)

- **Email 1 (Day 0):** pain + 10-day pilot + 2 time slots.
- **LI task:** connect.
- **Email 2 (Day 3):** one KPI outcome (+30% demos) + “worth a look?”
- **LI task:** short msg.
- **Email 3 (Day 7):** “30-sec overview; can share?”
- **Email 4 (Day 12):** “1-page pilot tailored to you?”
- **Email 5 (Day 20):** polite break-up.

**Email 1 template (subject: “More qualified demos in 10 days”)**

Hi {{Name}},

Teams lose demos to forms and random bots. ExoChat runs **playbooks** (clear steps): ask 3–5 key questions → score → **auto-book meeting** → write to CRM.

We can run a **10-day pilot** targeting **+30% demo bookings**.

15-min look {{Tue 11:00}} or {{Thu 15:00}}?

### 4.2 Seq B — Support Triage (CX)

- **Email 1:** cut AHT safely (pilot).
- **Email 2:** step-level analytics (drop-offs & fixes).
- **Email 3:** human handoff with full context.
- **Email 4:** template pilot for Zendesk/Intercom.
- **Email 5:** break-up.

**Email 1 template (subject: “Cut AHT safely (10-day pilot)”)**

Hi {{Name}},

Generic chatbots drift; agents get the mess. ExoChat runs **controlled playbooks** with guardrails and **step-level analytics**.

Pilot in **10 days** targeting **−20% AHT / +15% FCR**.

Quick 15-min walkthrough {{Wed}} or {{Fri}}?

---

## 5) LinkedIn (manual only)

**Connect note (≤300 chars)**

Hi {{Name}} — we run **controlled AI playbooks** for sales/support with a 10-day pilot. Would be great to connect.

**Message after accept**

Thanks, {{Name}}. If helpful, I can show a 15-min flow (lead-qual or support triage) and how we measure results **by step**. Which use case is more relevant?

**Rules**

- 10–15 connects/day/account; 5–10 short messages to accepts.
- No automation, no links in the connect note, vary phrasing.

---

## 6) Call flow (quick)

**Discovery (15 min)**

- Goal/KPI in their words → pick 1 use case & channel → confirm stack (CRM/help desk/calendar) → agree next step (demo).

**Demo (20–30 min)**

- Show one flow end-to-end → guardrails & human handoff → **step analytics** → propose **10-day pilot** (scope/KPI/traffic cap/dates).

**Pilot one-pager (send within 24h)**

- Use case, KPI, channels, integrations, traffic cap, 10-day timeline, deliverables, kickoff slots.

---

## 7) Logging rules (Notion)

- Update **Stage** after every meaningful touch.
- Always set **Next step + date**.
- Fill **Use case**, **Primary KPI**, **Stack**, **Champion/Econ buyer** by end of **Discovery**.
- Move to **Pilot Proposed** only after you send the one-pager.

---

## 8) Deliverability & safety

**Do**

- Use outreach subdomain; keep first emails short & plain.
- Personalize 1–2 lines for top accounts.
- Respect caps (**≤150 emails/mailbox/day**).

**Don’t**

- Attach files or add images on first touch.
- Send identical copy at scale.
- Automate LinkedIn.

---

## 9) Qualification cheatsheet

- Clear KPI in 30 days?
- One channel we can switch on fast? (web chat/help desk/Slack)
- Minimal access approved? (CRM/help desk/calendar)
- A champion who can say “yes” to a **10-day pilot**?

---

## 10) Example path (happy flow)

Email reply → Discovery booked → Demo done → Pilot one-pager sent (same day) → Kickoff next week → Day 10 results → Keep/kill decision.

---

## 11) Weekly report (paste in Notion)

- **Sent / replies / meetings / demos / pilots proposed / pilots live**
- **Top 3 insights** (what messaging worked)
- **Risks/blockers** (access, security, timing)
- **Asks** (materials, case, intro)

---

## 12) Quick glossary

- **Playbook** — step-by-step conversation flow.
- **Guardrails** — tone, no-go topics, fallback, handoff rules.
- **Step-level analytics** — conversion/drop-off per flow step.
- **Traffic cap** — limit of sessions during pilot to control risk/cost.
