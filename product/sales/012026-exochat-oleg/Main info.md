# ExoChat — AI conversations you can control

**In one line:**

ExoChat lets your company run AI chats that follow your rules, show your data, and drive real results in sales and support.

## The problem (why teams struggle)

- “Smart chatbots” often say the wrong thing, forget context, or break policy.
- It’s hard to prove business impact (leads, bookings, CSAT, cost).
- Pilots take too long and don’t turn into real outcomes.

## What ExoChat does (simple)

ExoChat gives you **conversation playbooks**.

Think of them as step-by-step flows: “If the user says X, do Y.”

You decide the steps and rules; the AI fills in the words—safely and on brand.

## Where it helps (top use cases)

- **Pre-sales & lead qualification:** ask the right questions, score the lead, book a demo.
- **Customer support:** triage, answer FAQs, collect details, and hand off to an agent when needed.
- **Onboarding & success:** guide users through setup, renewals, and upgrades.

## Why ExoChat is different

- **You stay in control:** clear flows, not random answers.
- **Easy to measure:** see drop-offs, conversions, and bookings by step.
- **Fast to try:** a focused 10-day pilot, not a 3-month project.
- **Works with your tools:** CRM, help desk, website chat, Slack/Teams.
- **Any AI model:** swap models without rebuilding your logic.

## How it works (60 seconds)

1. **Pick a use case** (e.g., “qualify website leads” or “support triage”).
2. **Define the playbook** (the steps and rules).
3. **Connect tools** (Calendars/CRM/Help desk or simple webhooks).
4. **Go live** on one channel (site widget, chat, Slack, etc.).
5. **Watch the numbers** (booked demos, AHT, FCR, CSAT, deflection, revenue).
6. **Improve** fast with small tweaks to the playbook.

## 10-day pilot (typical)

- **Days 1–2:** choose use case + success target (e.g., +30% demo bookings).
- **Days 3–5:** build a simple playbook and connect tools.
- **Days 6–8:** test internally, add safe fallbacks and human handoff.
- **Days 9–10:** run with real users, review results, decide next steps.

## What you’ll see (metrics that matter)

- **Sales:** more qualified leads, more demos booked, faster first response.
- **Support:** lower handling time, higher first-contact resolution, better CSAT.
- **Cost:** fewer repetitive tickets, clearer paths to human agents when needed.

## Security & trust (plain talk)

- We only use the data you allow.
- We keep logs so you can see what was said and why.
- You can set rules about tone, what not to say, and when to hand off to a human.
- Cloud or your own environment—your call.

## Pricing (simple)

- **Pilot:** fixed, small scope (1–2 playbooks).
- **After pilot:** platform subscription + usage.
    
    Exact price depends on volume and integrations.
    

## Call to action

- Pick one quick win (lead-qual or support triage).
- Set a target.
- Run a 10-day pilot and decide based on results.

**Status:** Ready for pilots, fast onboarding.
