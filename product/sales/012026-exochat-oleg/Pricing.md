# Pricing & Packaging

**When to talk price:** after discovery, before the demo ends. Lead with the **Trial Month** or **Annual Core** depending on their appetite.

## 0) Plain definitions

- **Playbook** = one step-by-step conversation flow for a task (e.g., Lead-Qual, Billing Triage).
- **Channel** = where it runs (Website widget, In-app, Slack/Teams, Email, WhatsApp via provider).
- **Integration** = a connection to a tool (HubSpot/Salesforce, Zendesk/Intercom, Google/Microsoft Calendar, etc.).
- **Session** = one user conversation up to 15 minutes of inactivity (used for usage/overage).

## 3) Guardrails for reps (how to quote fast)

- If they want **lowest risk** → start with **Trial Month $1,000**.
- If they want **annual value** → **Annual Core $10k**.
- If they’re very small → **Start Pack $500** (1 playbook only).
- Add channels/integrations as needed; if they ask for >2 playbooks, include **build fees** or a **care plan**.
- Don’t gift unlimited sessions—**add a cap** and quote overage.

---

## 4) Talk track (30 seconds)

“We scope one or two playbooks, run on the channel you care about, and include enough sessions for your volume. You can try it for a month at **$1,000**, or commit annually at **$10k** with consultations, guides, and token credit. If you need more flows or integrations, we add them as small, clear add-ons.”

---

## 5) FAQ that kills confusion

- **What happens if we exceed sessions?** You pay overage per session (see plan). We’ll flag usage before you hit the cap.
- **Do tokens cover everything?** The **$1,200** credit offsets model usage inside your included sessions; overage sessions still bill at per-session rates.
- **Can we pause?** Monthly plans can cancel any time for the next month. Annual is a 12-month term.
- **What’s a workspace?** A logical environment (settings, flows, users) for one team/business unit.
- **Support SLAs?** Start/Trial = next business day; Annual Core = business day + quarterly reviews; Premium Support available.
- **Security/PII?** Least-privilege connectors, redaction options, logs/audit, DPA/MSA on request.
