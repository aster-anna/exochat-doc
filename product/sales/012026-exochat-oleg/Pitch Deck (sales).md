# Pitch Deck (sales)

# Slide 1 — Title

**ExoChat: AI conversations you can control**

Run AI chats that follow your rules, use your data, and deliver results in sales & support.

**Callout:** Fast 10-day pilot. Clear metrics. Scale if it works.

---

# Slide 2 — The Problem

- “Smart chatbots” go off-script, give risky answers, and break brand tone.
- Hard to measure impact: did we get more demos, faster replies, higher CSAT?
- Pilots drag on for months and never become real projects.

**Impact:** lost leads, higher support costs, compliance risk.

---

# Slide 3 — The Solution (What ExoChat Does)

- ExoChat provides **conversation playbooks**: step-by-step flows (“If user says X, do Y”).
- You set rules; AI fills in natural language safely and on-brand.
- Built-in **analytics** show where users drop off and what converts.
- Works across your channels: website, chat, email, Slack/Teams.

**Outcome:** predictable, measurable, policy-safe AI conversations.

---

# Slide 4 — What the Product Looks Like

- **Flow builder:** create simple steps and branches (no heavy coding).
- **Guardrails:** define tone, no-go topics, and when to hand off to a human.
- **Memory:** keep the useful context for the session or longer if needed.
- **Handoff:** push to an agent with full chat history when needed.

**Your team edits the flow; ExoChat handles the AI.**

---

# Slide 5 — Who It’s For

- **B2B/B2C product companies** (Series A → growth) and **tech-enabled SMBs**.
- **VC funds & platform teams** standardizing pilots for portfolio companies.

**Buyer personas:**

- Head of Support/CX (deflection, AHT, FCR, CSAT)
- Head of Sales/RevOps (qualified leads, demo bookings)
- CPO/CTO (control, safety, fast iteration)

---

# Slide 6 — Top Use Cases

- **Pre-sales & lead qualification:** ask key questions, score, book meeting.
- **Customer support triage:** route, answer FAQs, collect details, handoff.
- **Onboarding & success:** guided setup, renewals, upsell nudges.

**Start with one quick win; scale to more flows later.**

---

# Slide 7 — 10-Day Pilot (How We Work)

- **Days 1–2:** pick use case + success target (e.g., +30% demo bookings or −20% AHT).
- **Days 3–5:** build playbook, connect tools (CRM/help desk/calendar).
- **Days 6–8:** internal testing, add safe fallbacks & human handoff.
- **Days 9–10:** limited live run, measure, decide to scale or stop.

**Clear outcome:** keep/kill decision backed by numbers.

---

# Slide 8 — Metrics & ROI (What You’ll See)

- **Sales:** more qualified leads, more demos booked, faster first response.
- **Support:** lower handling time, higher first-contact resolution, better CSAT.
- **Efficiency:** fewer repetitive tickets, smoother agent handoffs.
- **Attribution:** see results **by step** in the flow (what actually worked).
