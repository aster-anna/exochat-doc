# Pre-Call Research & Tailored Offer

**Purpose:** One page for Sales to prepare fast, run the call, and move to a 10-day pilot.

**Status:** Working draft. Assumptions may change; please suggest edits as you learn from clients.

---

## Quick start (read first)

1. Do **10 minutes** of research.
2. Write a **2-minute brief** and pick **one** use case.
3. Send the **pre-call email** with a simple pilot idea.
4. Run the call using the **mini-script**.
5. After the call, log data and send the **pilot one-pager**.

## 1) 10-minute research checklist

Fill quickly; do not deep dive.

- **What they sell (1–2 lines).**
- **Who they sell to:** B2B/B2C, SMB/mid-market/enterprise.
- **Volume signals:** chat widget, busy Help Center, many plans/users.
- **Current stack (best guess):** look at site footer, careers, LinkedIn.
- **Likely pains:** slow demo booking; many repetitive tickets; inconsistent answers; compliance risk.
- **People:** Support/CX lead, Head of Sales/RevOps, CPO/CTO.

*Sources:* homepage, pricing, Help Center, footer logos, careers, LinkedIn posts.

---

## 2) 2-minute brief (paste into CRM “Notes for offer”)

- **Company (1–2 lines):** {your summary}
- **Suspected use case:** {Lead-Qual / Support Triage / Onboarding}
- **Why now (trigger):** {one sentence}
- **Stack (guess):** {CRM / Help Desk / Calendar / Chat}
- **Primary KPI target:** {e.g., +30% demos or −20% AHT}

---

## 3) Choose the starting use case (rule of thumb)

- **Support Triage** if they have many tickets / rich Help Center.
- **Lead-Qualification** if lots of inbound forms / SDR time wasted.
- **Onboarding** if setup is complex or churn at month 1.

Pick one and keep scope small for the pilot.

## 5) Pre-call email (send after they say “interested”) EXAMPLE, CAN BE MODIFIED

**Subject:** Quick pilot idea for {Company} — 10 days

Hi {Name},

Ahead of our call, a simple pilot idea for {Company}: **{Use case}** with a clear KPI (**{KPI target}**). We’ll run controlled AI **playbooks** (step-by-step flows), add safe fallbacks and human handoff, and show results **by step** after 10 days.

If that sounds right, I’ll bring a 1-page outline and we can adjust it live.

Best,

{Your Name} — ExoChat

## 6) On-call mini-script (20–25 minutes)

1. **Align on the goal:** “What does success look like in 10 days?” → lock **one KPI**.
2. **Show one flow end-to-end** (Lead-Qual or Triage).
3. **Show guardrails** (tone, no-go topics, handoff triggers).
4. **Show step analytics** (where users drop, what we’ll improve).
5. **Close to pilot:** “Let’s run the 10-day pilot with {KPI}. Kickoff {date}?”

*If objections:*

- “We already have a bot.” → We **govern** it with flows/guardrails and show **step-level** analytics.
- “No time.” → Tiny scope; we do the heavy lifting; you provide KPI + access.
- “Compliance.” → Tone rules, no-go topics, logging, redaction, and safe handoff.

---

## 7) After the call — what to log & send

**Update CRM:**

- Use case (confirmed), KPI target (+ baseline if shared), stack (confirmed), decision makers, notes for offer.
- Move stage → **Pilot Proposed**.

**Send within 24h:**

- **Pilot one-pager** (use the template above, filled in).
